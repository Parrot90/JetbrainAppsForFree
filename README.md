I think that this tutorial will be useful to many. JetBrains products are quite popular, but not everyone has the money to buy a software subscription .

For example, for students, the company provides a license for its software for a year with some restrictions (it seems that there is even an extension). In this article I will tell you how to activate any product from JetBrains (PyCharm, PhpStorm, Webstorm and others) for free without any registration and SMS.

1 - PRODUCT INSTALL

THESE FILES AND THE TUTORIALS ARE NOT BEING WRITTEN BY ME BUT THE FILES ARE TESTED BY ME AND IT WORKED EVEN IN 2024...

THE AIM IS FOR THE STUDENT WHO WANT TO TRY THE PROFESSIONAL VERSION FOR FREE ...


It is advisable to drop the folder from the archive into the folder where the program is installed.

(This is done so that you do not delete it. If you delete the folder, then the entire license will be lost.)

Open Scripts and click on install-all-users

We open our software, and also go to the mirror where you downloaded the archive.
We find the name of the program and copy the key from here

Mac OS / Linux Activation

The principle of activation is exactly the same as that of Windows, only there are some details.

When you go to the Scripts folder, there will be a file

Open Terminal on the device, enter the sh command (we wrote and pressed enter), drag this file and press Enter. (After these steps, you can close the Terminal)

Next, we activate our program through the key, as on Windows.
